The functionality of this code is based on individual analysis of 10 open-access papers. 
In order to validate the results I have greated a series of test that help me check that the code is working correctly. 

The code works in a secuential way showing the wordcloud and links in the console once at a time. 
In order to continue with the execution you must close the figures that pop out. 
To check that the numbers figures and links correspond I have checked using the Grobid web service using one of the pdfs that I selected.
